Hello and Welcome to my Portfolio!

---

### Introduction

I am thrilled to introduce you to my journey into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence. This portfolio serves as a testament to my growing
expertise and passion for exploring cutting-edge technologies, particularly in the realm of large language models (LLMs). Here, I will document my
achievements, share insights from my experiments, and chronicle my continuous learning process.

### My Initial Experiment: Running DeepSeek Models Locally

Recently, I embarked on an exciting project to run **DeepSeek-r1:14b** and **DeepSeek-r1:18b** models locally. This endeavor was made possible through
the use of a **Linux virtual machine** hosted on my Windows system via **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.

#### Why WSL?

Choosing WSL as the medium for this experiment was strategic. It allows me to leverage the full power of Linux-based tools and environments directly
from my Windows operating system, bridging the gap between two worlds seamlessly. This setup has been instrumental in facilitating my exploration of
AI without compromising on performance or flexibility.

#### The Setup Process

1. **Virtual Machine Installation**: I set up a virtual machine using Oracle VirtualBox to encapsulate my Linux environment. This isolated space
ensures that all AI-related tools and configurations are neatly contained, avoiding conflicts with my primary system.

2. **DeepSeek Models**: Acquiring and configuring the DeepSeek models was a task filled with curiosity and learning. These models, available in 14
billion and 18 billion parameters, represent significant computational demands. Running them locally required careful consideration of hardware
capabilities, particularly in terms of CPU and GPU resources.

3. **Optimization and Challenges**: The journey wasn’t without its hurdles. I faced challenges related to memory management, resource allocation, and
ensuring that my system could handle the intensive computations these models require. Through trial and error, I refined my approach, optimizing
performance while maintaining stability.

#### What’s Next?

This initial experiment has ignited a passion for fine-tuning AI models and understanding their inner workings. My goal is to expand this exploration
by experimenting with other models, tweaking parameters, and ultimately contributing to the broader AI community by sharing my findings.
